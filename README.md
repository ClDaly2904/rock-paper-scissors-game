# Rock Paper Scissors

## About
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic game of chance presented to the user in the form of a browser based game.

The purpose of the site is to entertain both new and returning users by allowing them to compete against the computer, where the first to win three draws wins the overall game.

For first time users, the site has a welcome page where they may view the rules of the game and there is clear navigation between the site's two pages. As the computer randomly generates their choice, the game remains challenging for returning players. 

## Features
### Colourscheme
As Rock Paper Scissors is ultimately a game, I wanted to make the site a fun space. For this reason I chose to provide users with a colourful gradient background. I used an eyedropper tool to pick the exact colours from the three main images used (the rock, paper and scissors icons) and used ColorSpace's gradient generator[https://mycolor.space/gradient3] to create a vibrant background that maintained colour continuity for the user.
I paired this with large white areas for much of the gameplay so as not to distract the user from the game itself and to ensure there was still sufficient contrast for the user.
### Fonts
I settled on Jet Brains Mono for the headings in Rock Paper Scissors as it is a basic but computer-like font, reminiscent of the retro direction I have taken this browser-based game. Sora was chosen as a complimentary font for the body as it still has a computer-like feel but is slightly softer. Both fonts are very easy to read and greatly accessible to both users. They were chosen from an article by awwwards. on the [20 Best Google Fonts](https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html).
