# Rock Paper Scissors

## About
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic game of chance presented to the user in the form of a browser based game.

The purpose of the site is to entertain both new and returning users by allowing them to compete against the computer, where the first to win three draws wins the overall game.

For first time users, the site has a welcome page where they may view the rules of the game and there is clear navigation between the site's two pages. As the computer randomly generates their choice, the game remains challenging for returning players.

## Features

### Colourscheme

As Rock Paper Scissors is ultimately a game, I wanted to make the site a fun space. For this reason I chose to provide users with a colourful gradient background. I used an eyedropper tool to pick the exact colours from the three main images used (the rock, paper and scissors icons) and used ColorSpace's gradient generator[https://mycolor.space/gradient3] to create a vibrant background that maintained colour continuity for the user.

I paired this with large white areas for much of the gameplay so as not to distract the user from the game itself and to ensure there was still sufficient contrast for the user.

I also added a fallback background colour that was a transition colour between the pink and blue of the gradient in case the gradient image failed to load in the browser.

### Fonts

I settled on Jet Brains Mono for the headings in Rock Paper Scissors as it is a basic but computer-like font, reminiscent of the retro direction I have taken this browser-based game. Sora was chosen as a complimentary font for the body as it still has a computer-like feel but is slightly softer. Both fonts are very easy to read and greatly accessible to both users. They were chosen from an article by awwwards. on the [20 Best Google Fonts](https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html).

### Home button

- Contained in the header
- Provides the user with a simple way to navigate between the home and play pages
- Use of home icon to make the navigation buttons intuitive for first time users

### Player name input

- Allows the user to use a chosen player name
- Gives the game a more personal feel and allows user to further engage with the game

### Rules

- Modal popup box triggered by the click of the 'Rules' button on the homepage
- Allows first time users to read and understand the rules of the game
- Sets the terms of overall victory for users new to the game, but also to those familiar to the game of Rock Paper Scissors

### Buttons

- Following user feedback during the testing phase of creating Rock Paper Scissors, I increased the size of the buttons to make sure they were a clickable size on the site and gave them hover features. This meant that the presence of the buttons were not only more obvious to users as features on the page, but also provided better feeback from the page to the user and improved experience. However, as covered within my TESTING.md file, I ended up disabling the hover effects for users with touch devices as their rock, paper, scissors choice button remained in their hover state until the next one was chosen, resulting in confusing user feedback.

### Player choice buttons

- The player choice buttons are the only three buttons in the gameplay area so as not to confuse or distract the user
- Clearly labelled
- User is directed to select one of the buttons by a greeting in the result area telling them to "choose from one of the buttons above to get started" which helps to define their role within the game

### Area to display player and computer choice icons

- Each time the user makes their choice, both the images contained in the player choice and computer choice display divs are updated to reflect the choices made
- This is a great visual aid for the user as allows them to see quickly what the computer has played without having to read the message in the result message area
- Keeps consistent use of the rock, paper, scissors icons accross the site
- Adds a greater sense of interactivity for the user rather than just being a fairly static browser based game

### Result message area

- Gives the user feedback on their input and the play generated by the computer
- Breaks down the outcome of the draw for the user, which is great for users with screenreaders that would find it more difficult to rely on the updated images (although alt attributes do also update)

### Sound effects

- Three different sound effects used for win, draw and lose to differentiate outcomes for users
- Can be controlled at the top of the page with a toggle that is clearly marked by a volume icon

### Scoreboard

- Uses stored variable of player name to invest the user
- Displays running total of draws won by the user and computer so user can see how close they are to a victory or a loss
- Resets after each match
- I had originally planned for the game to be a first to 3 competition. However during the testing phase, I felt that this was a little short and that the user may get frustrated by constantly having to restart the game so upped the match victory requirements to the first to win 5 draws

### Victory and defeat popup modals

- Upon the user being the first to reach 5 points, a 'Victory' message will be displayed in the form of a modal popup to congratulate them
- Upon the computer being the first to reach 5 points, a 'Defeat' message will be displayed
- Both messages let the user know that to play again they must click the red cross for the game to reset
- As with the rules popup modal, the user may also simply click outside of the modal for it to disappear and the game to reset

## Possible Future Features

### Countdown timer

- Display a countdown timer from 3. Triggered when user has chosen their input play, countdown to show computer play and draw outcome. Adds tension and excitement for user
